Description:
<br>
<p>One of the very first video games I played before I could comprehend what I was playing was a video game. The objective of the game was to align the sword on screen with the enemies that appeared using the physical sword that came with the game,once ready you swing the sword in the desired direction and your character would attack. Being only 3 years old at the time, I just swung randomly in hopes that I would hit something, anything. This was also my first experience using motion controls which would later be popularized with the likes of the XBOX Kinect and Nintendo Wii.

<p>Wii Sports (Wii)</p>

<p>Played by: Jaymian Bustos</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>An all time classic and automatic staple for anyone who bought a Wii. I loved creating horrendous looking charicatures of my family members and using them to play various sports. Each of the sports were all absolute bangers that would stand the test of time being able to play by yourself and the whole family. Not to mention the soundtrack for the game becoming a classic through internet culture to this day. Wii sports was truly one of my fondest games for how much it allowed for me and my family to connect through video games.</p>

<h2>2007</h2>
<p>The World Ends With You (Nintendo DS)</p>
<p>Developer: Square Enix</p>
<img src="img/theworldendswithyou.jpg"/>
<p>Played By: Danny Dao</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>The World Ends With You was the game that made me fall in love with video games. The storytelling, the worldbuilding, and the overall art direction of the game changed me at an important time in my life.
    I was transitioning from middle school to high school and was a quiet kid with little to no social interaction. The World Ends With You's main character, Neku, was an asocial teenage boy who claims that he doesn't "get"
    people, and rarely interacts with others despite going through the busy streets of the Shibuya shopping district in Tokyo, Japan. One day, Neku, gets put into a death game where if he wins the game, he will be resurrected
    as a "higher" human being. Throughout his time in the games, he learns to establish friendships with all types of different people and breaks free of his asocial habits. This was one of the first games that taught me the importance
    of human social interaction and what it feels to make connections with people.

<h2>2008</h2>
<p>Adventure Quest: World's</p>
<img src="" alt="">
<p>Played by Jaymian Bustos</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>My first introduction to MMO RPGs and online play in general. My cousins had introduced this game to me where I dawned my first username that I stole from my grandpa "Hoser6" where I would constantly grind out the game's story and explore the vastness of this 2D world. Although a great game, this was also my first encounter with Pay-2-Win aspects as many of the cooler and stronger items of the game were locked behind a paywall subscription, a harsh feature that would eventually make me drop the game entirely.</p>
<h2>2009</h2>
<p>League of Legends (PC)</p>
<p>Developer: Riot Games</p>
<img src="img/lol.jpeg"/>
<p>Played By: Danny Dao</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>League of Legends was my first online multiplayer game and it has led me to create many friendships with people all throughout the world. It's still a game that I return to do this day as it has a way of reconnecting people who haven't talked together
    for awhile. League of Legends, oddly enough, was the first competitive game that I enjoyed taking a more casual approach. Meeting people and having a good time together to try to beat the other team was what made it such a good game. This was the first game that
    made me have a huge appreciation for the diversity in digital art.

<p>PokePark: Pikachu's Adventure</p>
<img src="" alt="">
<p>Played by Jaymian Bustos</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>As a long time Pokemon fan, from watching the show every Monday morning before school to coming back home to play the games on my Nintendo DS, I was dumbfounded by the concept of a Pokemon game where you play as a Pokemon. Rather than creatures doing your bidding you can actually interact and get to know Pokemon as their own fleshed out characters from playing mini games and the different environments they inhabit in the park. But the best part was actually having real-time combat which was the closest to the show as it could possibly be at the time. </p>
<h2>2010</h2>
<p>Persona 3 Portable(Playstation Portable)</p>
<p>Developer: Atlus</p>
<img src="img/p3p.jpg"/>
<p>Played By: Danny Dao</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>Persona 3 truly taught me what it meant to live life in the face of an inevitable death while introducing me to an entire new genre of music. Persona 3 is a RPG that intertwines a character in high school with a night life of 
    erasing demons from existence. What made Persona 3 stand out to me was each of the chracters' development and how they strive and choose to face death. Each character was faced with different circumstances and made the best out of what
    they were given. They never gave up hope. At this time, I was finding myself and figuring out who I was. Albeit Persona was a fantasy game, it reminded me of how important it was to make each day of our lives meaningful, that death was 
    unavoidable, and who knows what goes on after that.
