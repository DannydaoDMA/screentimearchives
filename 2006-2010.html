<br>
    <p>Another game created after a childhood movie of mine, <i>Pixar's Cars</i>. One of the first games that revealed that motion sickness was very well a thing for me and for future games to come. I was quite sad that I could not play this game featuring a Mario Kart-esque play style but my brain just could not handle how the camera moved around the screen.</p>

<br>
<p> An adaptation of the movie that would be released a month later, Transformer: The Game was a third-person shooter game where you would travel through a sandbox world with various transformers depending on the faction that you choose (Decepticons or Autobots) completing missions to get closer to get the All-Spark Cube an artifact the transformers value highly due to the immense power it granted. Unfortunately, I was unable to get passed any of the levels once again due to motion sickness. However, it was quite fun watching my dad play the game for me when on the verge of losing my lunch.</p>
