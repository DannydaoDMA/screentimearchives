        <h1>Video Game Archive</h1>

        <p>Video games are not only a way of escapism from a person's day to day life but also act as a reflection of said individual, depending on the games they play as well as the period of time the game came out. They also can change one's perspective of the world around them and deepen the connections one may have with people creating new memories and experiences from everywhere and anywhere. With that being said, these
            archives are a way that we can look back on the history of how video games have impacted in our lives and pointed us in the direction that we are at today. Thus, looking at these archives, you may be able to relate to the experiences and reflect on how video games have made the person you are today.
