        <h1>Video Game Archive</h1>

        <p>Video games are not only a way of escapism from a person's day to day life but also act as a reflection of said individual depending on the games they play as well as the period of time the game came out. They also can change one's perspective about the world around them and deepen the connections we have with people around us creating new memories and experiences from everywhere and anywhere. That being said we would like to take a look back at our video game history to reflect on our lives and how we have developed as people. </p>
