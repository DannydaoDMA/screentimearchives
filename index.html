        <h1>Video Game Memory Lane</h1>

        <p>Video games are not only made to be a form of escapism. They also teach us viable lessons that are applicable to reality. They can be a reflection of oneself. They can change oneâ€™s perspective of the world around them while deepening connections with others. They help us to create new memories and experiences, ones that are not simply possible without the internet, with people from everywhere and anywhere. Thus, through looking at these archives, we hope that you may be able to relate to these experiences and reflect on how video games have had a place in your lives.</p>
