<p>Description:</p>
<p>Palworld, a game that seemingly brought back memories of dreams of playing Pokemon in a 3D interactive environment where battles were not turn based and instead run in real time. Palworld 
    brought back friends that I hadn't talked to for a long time as we all messaged each other asking to play this game. There was controversy all throughout the game signifying the use of AI and
    what that means for video games as a whole. What matters more, the final product or the work behind the product? Questions were asked all around my group of friends, but at the end of the day, the game
    was something that the public had wanted for awhile and it turned out to be loads of fun. Catching pals and creating "friendships" with them were something that we were all longing for.
