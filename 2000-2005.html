<p>Description:</p>
<p>Humongous Entertainment was my first introduction to video games and it changed my life forever. As a kid, my parents pushed me to learn, but they could sense that
    reading books was extremely boring to me so they introduced other ways of interaction as a way to learn. Thus paved the way for these huge catalog of educational video games. I think
    that the start of this was what lead me down the long age of video games and I don't think I would be who I am today if I wasn't introduced to these games.

<p>Description:</p>
<p>Pokemon as an entire series created a bunch of friendships in my childhood years. My first friendship that I could remember was established through our interests for Pokemon and I remember the
    majority of the time we spent together was trading Pokemon and talking about Pokemon. If I wasn't doing things that were school related, I was playing Pokemon as soon as I got home from school. Pokemon changed my life then and some
    of my closest friendships today were made through those days of playing Pokemon.

Description:
<br>
<p>One of the very first video games I played before I could comprehend what I was playing was a video game. The objective of the game was to align the sword on screen with the enemies that appeared using the physical sword that came with the game,once ready you swing the sword in the desired direction and your character would attack. Being only 3 years old at the time, I just swung randomly in hopes that I would hit something, anything. This was also my first experience using motion controls which would later be popularized with the likes of the XBOX Kinect and Nintendo Wii.

    <br>
    Based on the 1999 film Toy Story 2, a classic watch for any kids at the time. I have fond memories reliving the movie through the platforming game, although I never really understood how to get past the second level. Nonetheless, during this time all the game had to do was let me play as Buzz as that's all I cared about at the time.
