<br>
<p>One of the very first video games I played before I could comprehend what I was playing was a video game. The objective of the game was to align the sword on screen with the enemies that appeared using the physical sword that came with the game,once ready you swing the sword in the desired direction and your character would attack. Being only 3 years old at the time, I just swung randomly in hopes that I would hit something, anything. This was also my first experience using motion controls which would later be popularized with the likes of the XBOX Kinect and Nintendo Wii.

    Based on the 1999 film Toy Story 2, a classic watch for any kids at the time. I have fond memories reliving the movie through the platforming game, although I never really understood how to get past the second level. Nonetheless, during this time all the game had to do was let me play as Buzz as that's all I cared about at the time.
